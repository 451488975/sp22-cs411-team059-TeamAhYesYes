## Project Summary
Our project is a web application for the Pet Shops. In this web app, users will be able to browse different pets
according to their taste of type, species, color, size, etc. There will be a detailed information page about the pets we
have in the shop when users found their likes. Other than pets themselves, we also intend to include contents for pet
supplies, foods, toys, to make our shop a one-stop destination for all people who love pets in the Urbana-Champaign
area.
